----------

There are 2 models used in this project, which are Word2Vec model and  Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Word2Vec Model


## LSTM Model


Explain why we use F1 score and suggest other metrics relevant for evaluation of a model and why it may or may not be better.

F1 Score is a metric that takes both precision and recall into account. Accuracy may not be suitable when the distribution of data is not balance.


Additionally, in the report explain the trade offs of each model and you might modify each model to improve the score.

Why would you add those improvements and how would these changes improve the score and what would the trade offs be?
